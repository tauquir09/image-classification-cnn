# Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This project demonstrates a basic image classification system built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It provides a starting point for understanding and implementing image classification tasks with deep learning.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to train a CNN model to classify images into predefined categories. The repository includes:

* **`model.py`**: Contains the definition of the CNN architecture (e.g., using TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch).
* **`train.py`**: Script for training the CNN model on the image dataset.
* **`evaluate.py`**: Script for evaluating the trained model's performance on a test dataset.
* **`predict.py`**: Script to make predictions on new, unseen images.
* **`data/`**: (Potentially) Contains the image dataset or scripts to download/preprocess it.
* **`notebooks/`**: (Optional) Jupyter notebooks for experimentation, data exploration, and model development.
* **`requirements.txt`**: Lists the Python libraries required to run the project.
* **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through setting up and running the image classification project.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

* **Python 3.x**
* **pip** (Python package installer)

You will also need to install the necessary Python libraries. It's recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
# venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
